# 📚 A Comprehensive Survey of Image Steganography

---

### 🔍 Extended Description

This repository showcases the results of a research study titled **"A Comprehensive Survey of Image Steganography"**, aimed at providing a broad and deep understanding of the field of image-based data hiding. It reviews and compares a wide spectrum of steganographic techniques—from foundational spatial domain methods like Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), to advanced machine learning-driven techniques leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The study systematically analyzes the trade-offs among these methods in terms of embedding capacity, visual imperceptibility, security, and computational complexity. It also identifies major challenges faced in practical deployment, such as robustness against steganalysis, real-time implementation barriers, and adversarial attacks.

By combining traditional and modern perspectives, the work serves as both an educational resource and a reference guide for future innovations in secure image communication. This repository includes the full research paper in PDF format, along with summaries and structured documentation suitable for researchers, developers, and students working in information security, multimedia processing, or computer vision.
